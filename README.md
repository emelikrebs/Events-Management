# Events-Management

(Full-Stack Web Application for Academic Event Management)
This repository showcases the final technical graduation project (TCC) in Informatics. The system was developed to computerize and centralize event management at IFPR – Campus Irati, replacing manual processes (paper and Google Forms) and automating certificate issuance.

Key Features and Value Added
Certificate Automation: Automates the generation and email delivery of certificates, resolving issues related to manual issuance and delayed student receipt.

Full CRUD Management: Allows administrators to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for events, activities, instructors, and users.

Attendance Control: Generates call lists for attendance tracking, enabling accurate calculation of credit hours for certificate issuance.

Architecture Pattern: Developed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to ensure separation of concerns, maintainability, and code scalability.

Technologies and Methodology
Backend: Java (Servlets/JSP)

Data Persistence: Hibernate (ORM Framework)

Database: MySQL (SGBD), utilizing structured SQL queries.

Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with Materialize framework).

Agile Methodology: Used Feature Driven Development (FDD) for planning and iterative feature delivery.

⚠️ Important Note (Disclaimer)
This repository contains the application's code structure (skeleton) and front-end logic only. Database configuration files, passwords, and sensitive API keys (e.g., JavaMail credentials) have been omitted for security purposes, as they contain private institutional and database information.
